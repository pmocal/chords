A web application that allows the user to input a note through its GUI and then generates several different chords that contain the note, all of which play the chords, using a MIDI API, upon being clicked. This app would be extremely useful for the process of arranging music where one often needs construct chords around melodic lines composed of single notes. 

Note: This is a work in progress--the chord playing functionality is not yet done. There is more frontend and backend development pending.
